# 🧠 Zeno Paradoxes Simulator

This repository provides three interactive Pygame simulations that visually present the iconic paradoxes of Zeno of Elea:

- **Achilles and the Tortoise**
- **The Dichotomy**
- **The Arrow in Flight**

A main menu allows users to select the paradox to explore and activate an educational “Zeno mode” for step-by-step reasoning.

## 🎮 Available Simulations

### 1. Achilles and the Tortoise

- Simulates the race between Achilles and a stationary tortoise.
- Displays both positions and calculates their progress at each time step.
- Highlights the paradox: the tortoise always seems ahead, but, in practice, Achilles overtakes it.

### 2. The Dichotomy

- Illustrates a rock crossing a segment by repeatedly halving the remaining distance.
- Demonstrates the infinite sequence of steps and the convergence of their sum.

### 3. Arrow in Flight

- Simulates the trajectory of a launched arrow, incorporating physics (initial speed, angle, gravity).
- Zeno mode displays the arrow’s position, time interval (Δt), and instantaneous speed at each step.
- Explores the paradox: at any instant, the arrow appears motionless, though movement emerges over sequences of moments.

## 🧩 Paradox Details

### Achilles & the Tortoise

- Python program visualizes the pursuit.
- Each cycle, Achilles advances to the tortoise’s previous location, but the tortoise keeps moving.
- Shows the mathematical convergence where Achilles eventually catches up.

### The Dichotomy

- Stepwise simulation of distance traversal by halves.
- Graphically presents how an infinite number of intervals results in a finite path.

### Arrow in Flight

- Visualizes projectile motion in discrete time steps.
- Zeno mode elucidates time intervals, positions, and instantaneous speeds, demonstrating real motion via successive instants.
